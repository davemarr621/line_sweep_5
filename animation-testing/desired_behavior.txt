line moves down -> line sweep does this, done. looks awesome.
as it processes line segments, it will highlight any area of intersection
user can stop, rewind, move forward, etc. using a play button scroller (see that jake guy's blog for examples)


issues:
make line sweeping look smooth, even though it's actually really "jumping" based on a priority queue.
